	Hi my n
	{Nikolaos Ballas} let's stick to Nik, it's easier for everyone
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I am a father of two little devils and earn bucks by typing keys!Ain't that cool?
		\item I love technical scuba diving

\section{Microservices in pure grenglish}
	\subsection{What is/are microservices}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\underline{What is/are microservices}}
	The definition of someone who learned the hardway is:
	Microservices refer to a style of software architecture that targets at the following characteristics.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Small code base
		\item Distributed teams working on different features
		\item Strong decouping between features and teams
		\item Targets micro : both in size and life span
		\item Tightly coupled with development of high throughput fault tolerant systems
	\end{enumerate}
	A big question. Does the applications you build have these exact requirements(functional and non functional?)
	aka, do you need to deliver a system that does more than several thousands concurent requests per second?
\end{frame}
	\subsection{Software Developmente Lifecycle for Microservices}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\underline{SDLC for Microservices}}
if you plan addopting the microservices architecture don't forget the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create small cohesive code bases
		\item Try to follow zero trust model design.
		\item Security needs to be baked in since day 0 of your services
		\item CI/CD is part of the development process
		\item Infrastructure as a code is part of the development process
		\item Memorize 12 factor apps
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Long live k8s}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\underline{Long live k8s}}
	Kubernetes(k8s):	Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google. What you should know about it:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It's a foundation for building PaaS
		\item It's an orchstrator for distributed systems
		\item It's a complex system to manage and operate
		\item There are not mature enterprise ready products that can make support easier for more junior profiles
		\item Welcome to the desert of distributed systems
	\end{enumerate}
	Word of advice: Fail to consider above, most likely your microservices endeavour will be a disaster.

\section{Problem statement}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\underline{Problem statement-Challenge}}
	The business dept X reached out to the super IT Manager and asked him the following:
	 \\Can we have an application that can be smart?
	 \\Can we have it yesterday, because it  will impact the revenue of the company?
\end{frame}


\section{Talk is cheap, show me the code(not only)}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\underline{What is going to happen?}}
	I will be creating an application from scratch and my target is to stop when:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There is a critical decision to make
		\item You have it figure out wrongly
		\item When complexity increases eventhough you didn't expect it
		\item There is an interesting question
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\section{Remember the initial question?}

	\frametitle{\underline{What did business asked you to do?}}
	Let's take a step back and reflect...
